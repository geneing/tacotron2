DUMMY/LJ048-0143.f32|the Secret Service did not at the time of the assassination have any established procedure governing its relationships with them.
DUMMY/LJ012-0054.f32|Solomons, while waiting to appear in court, persuaded the turnkeys to take him to a public-house, where all might "refresh."

DUMMY/LJ014-0326.f32|Maltby and Co. would issue warrants on them deliverable to the importer, and the goods were then passed to be stored in neighboring warehouses.
DUMMY/LJ001-0173.f32|The essential point to be remembered is that the ornament, whatever it is, whether picture or pattern-work, should form part of the page,
DUMMY/LJ050-0056.f32|On December twenty-six, nineteen sixty-three, the FBI circulated additional instructions to all its agents,
DUMMY/LJ003-0319.f32|provided only that their security was not jeopardized, and dependent upon the enforcement of another new rule,
DUMMY/LJ006-0040.f32|The fact was that the years as they passed, nearly twenty in all, had worked but little permanent improvement in this detestable prison.
DUMMY/LJ017-0231.f32|His body was found lying in a pool of blood in a night-dress, stabbed over and over again in the left side.
DUMMY/LJ017-0226.f32|One half of the mutineers fell upon him unawares with handspikes and capstan-bars.
DUMMY/LJ004-0239.f32|He had been committed for an offense for which he was acquitted.
DUMMY/LJ048-0112.f32|The Commission also regards the security arrangements worked out by Lawson and Sorrels at Love Field as entirely adequate.
DUMMY/LJ039-0125.f32|that Oswald was a good shot, somewhat better than or equal to -- better than the average let us say.
DUMMY/LJ030-0196.f32|He cried out, quote, Oh, no, no, no. My God, they are going to kill us all, end quote,
DUMMY/LJ010-0228.f32|He was released from Broadmoor in eighteen seventy-eight, and went abroad.
DUMMY/LJ045-0228.f32|On the other hand, he could have traveled some distance with the money he did have and he did return to his room where he obtained his revolver.
DUMMY/LJ028-0168.f32|in the other was the sacred precinct of Jupiter Belus,
DUMMY/LJ021-0140.f32|and in such an effort we should be able to secure for employers and employees and consumers
DUMMY/LJ009-0280.f32|Again the wretched creature succeeded in obtaining foothold, but this time on the left side of the drop.
DUMMY/LJ003-0159.f32|To constitute this the aristocratic quarter, unwarrantable demands were made upon the space properly allotted to the female felons,
DUMMY/LJ016-0274.f32|and the windows of the opposite houses, which commanded a good view, as usual fetched high prices.
DUMMY/LJ035-0014.f32|it sounded high and I immediately kind of looked up,
DUMMY/LJ033-0120.f32|which he believed was where the bag reached when it was laid on the seat with one edge against the door.

DUMMY/LJ019-0221.f32|It was intended as far as possible that, except awaiting trial, no prisoner should find himself relegated to Newgate.
DUMMY/LJ003-0088.f32|in one, for seven years -- that of a man sentenced to death, for whom great interest had been made, but whom it was not thought right to pardon.
DUMMY/LJ045-0216.f32|nineteen sixty-three, merely to disarm her and to provide a justification of sorts,
DUMMY/LJ042-0135.f32|that he was not yet twenty years old when he went to the Soviet Union with such high hopes and not quite twenty-three when he returned bitterly disappointed.
DUMMY/LJ049-0196.f32|On the other hand, it is urged that all features of the protection of the President and his family should be committed to an elite and independent corps.
DUMMY/LJ018-0278.f32|This was the well and astutely devised plot of the brothers Bidwell,
DUMMY/LJ030-0238.f32|and then looked around again and saw more of this movement, and so I proceeded to go to the back seat and get on top of him.
DUMMY/LJ018-0309.f32|where probably the money still remains.
DUMMY/LJ041-0199.f32|is shown most clearly by his employment relations after his return from the Soviet Union. Of course, he made his real problems worse to the extent
DUMMY/LJ007-0076.f32|The lax discipline maintained in Newgate was still further deteriorated by the presence of two other classes of prisoners who ought never to have been inmates of such a jail.
DUMMY/LJ039-0118.f32|He had high motivation. He had presumably a good to excellent rifle and good ammunition.
DUMMY/LJ024-0019.f32|And there may be only nine.
DUMMY/LJ008-0085.f32|The fire had not quite burnt out at twelve, in nearly four hours, that is to say.
DUMMY/LJ018-0031.f32|This fixed the crime pretty certainly upon Müller, who had already left the country, thus increasing suspicion under which he lay.

DUMMY/LJ039-0096.f32|This is a definite advantage to the shooter, the vehicle moving directly away from him and the downgrade of the street, and he being in an elevated position
DUMMY/LJ041-0195.f32|Oswald's interest in Marxism led some people to avoid him,
DUMMY/LJ047-0158.f32|After a moment's hesitation, she told me that he worked at the Texas School Book Depository near the downtown area of Dallas.
DUMMY/LJ050-0162.f32|In planning its data processing techniques,

DUMMY/LJ034-0134.f32|Shortly after the assassination Brennan noticed
DUMMY/LJ019-0348.f32|Every facility was promised. The sanction of the Secretary of State would not be withheld if plans and estimates were duly submitted,
DUMMY/LJ010-0219.f32|While one stood over the fire with the papers, another stood with lighted torch to fire the house.

DUMMY/LJ010-0030.f32|The brutal ferocity of the wild beast once aroused, the same means, the same weapons were employed to do the dreadful deed,
DUMMY/LJ038-0047.f32|Some of the officers saw Oswald strike McDonald with his fist. Most of them heard a click which they assumed to be a click of the hammer of the revolver.
DUMMY/LJ009-0074.f32|Let us pass on.
DUMMY/LJ048-0069.f32|Efforts made by the Bureau since the assassination, on the other hand,
DUMMY/LJ003-0211.f32|They were never left quite alone for fear of suicide, and for the same reason they were searched for weapons or poisons.
DUMMY/LJ048-0053.f32|It is the conclusion of the Commission that, even in the absence of Secret Service criteria
DUMMY/LJ033-0093.f32|Frazier estimated that the bag was two feet long, quote, give and take a few inches, end quote, and about five or six inches wide.
DUMMY/LJ006-0149.f32|The turnkeys left the prisoners very much to themselves, never entering the wards after locking-up time, at dusk, till unlocking next morning,
DUMMY/LJ018-0211.f32|The false coin was bought by an agent from an agent, and dealings were carried on secretly at the "Clock House" in Seven Dials.
DUMMY/LJ008-0054.f32|This contrivance appears to have been copied with improvements from that which had been used in Dublin at a still earlier date,

DUMMY/LJ024-0034.f32|What do they mean by the words "packing the Court"?
